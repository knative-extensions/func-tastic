# Required. One or more Buildpack builder image names capable of transforming
# this language pack's function source code into a container image. These values
# are copied directly to a function project's func.yaml file, allowing the
# function developer to choose between them in local build configurations
builders:
  default: gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/builder:base
  base: gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/builder:base
  full: gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/builder:full

# Optional. A list of additional Buildpacks to be applied to the language pack's
# builder image when the function is built
buildpacks:
  - paketo-buildpacks/go-dist
  - ghcr.io/boson-project/go-function-buildpack:tip
# optional.  Invocation defines hints for how Functions created using this
# template can be invoked.  These settings can be updated on the resultant
# Function as development progresses to ensure 'invoke' can always trigger the
# execution of a running Function instance for testing and development.
invocation:
  # Invocations of Functions from this template is via basic HTTP CloudEvent
  format: "cloudevent"
